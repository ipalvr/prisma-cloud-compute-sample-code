# pcs-compute-report-generator
This project creates HTML or PDF reports for Vulnerability and Compliance data pulled from a Prisma Cloud Compute (formerly Twistlock) instance.

## Setup
First clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/twistlock/sample-code.git
```

It is recommended you create a virtual environment to keep installed python packages isolated from the rest of your system:

```
cd sample-code/Reporting/Reporting-v2
```
```
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate it:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Next you will need to install the required python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you will need to install [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) for your platform.  Use the below command for Mac OS.  

```
homebrew: brew install --cask wkhtmltopdf
```

## Environment Variables
To run reports with this script you will need 3 environment variables:

| Environment Variable     | Description                               |
|----------------------    |-------------------------------------------|
| COMPUTE_CONSOLE_ADDRESS  | Compute Console address                   |
| COMPUTE_ACCESS_KEY       | Your username for the instance            |
| COMPUTE_SECRET_KEY       | Your password                             |

See below for the example commands to set the environment variables. 
```
export COMPUTE_CONSOLE_ADDRESS=https://compute-console
export COMPUTE_ACCESS_KEY=<username or access key>
export COMPUTE_SECRET_KEY=<password or secret key>
```

## Usage Examples
`create_report.py` creates customized vulnerability and compliance reports using several options. Below are some examples:

To create summary report (do not include vulnerability and compliance details, just stats):
```
create_report.py --summary
```

To create an HTML report:
```
create_report.py -f html
```

To create a vulnerability only report:
```
create_report.py -vo
```

To create a report for a specific collection, or list of collections:
```
create_report.py -c collection1 collection 2 ...
```

To list all collections and exit (No report generated):
```
create_report.py --list-collections
```

The full list of options is below:
```
usage: create_report.py [-h] [-d] [-t {deployed,registry,ci}] [-f {pdf,html}] [-c COLLECTIONS [COLLECTIONS ...]] [-s] [-vo] [-co] [-lc]
